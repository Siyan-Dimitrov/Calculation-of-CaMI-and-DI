Wolfram functions calculating informational quantities -  causal mutual information (CaMI) and directionality index (DI)
CaMI and DI can be used as quantities to infer causality.

To use the functions, follow the instructions provided in the notebooks in the repository. Please remember that these fucntions can only handle bivariate time series data, where the input values have been normalised between 0 and 1.
